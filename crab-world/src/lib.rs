//! `crab_world` library surface.
//!
//! The RL crab machinery — [`bot`], [`physics`], [`training`], [`play`] — that both the
//! headless trainer and the renderers build on. The networking layer lives in the separate
//! `net` crate, which depends on this one (it drives these crabs into multiplayer); a
//! dependency the other way would be a cycle. The training binary and the `game` binary both
//! link this one library, so there is ONE copy of every module — no duplicated crab /
//! physics / brain implementation across binaries.

// rl#49: the `--features wgpu` build resolves `Module: Send` on `load_record` for
// `AnyBrain<Autodiff<Wgpu>>`, chasing wgpu_core's nested generics past the default
// 128-deep recursion limit and aborting with E0275 (overflow, not a genuine !Send). A
// higher limit lets that finite-but-deep resolution complete. ONLY needed under `wgpu`
// — every other build (the headless CPU trainer, the renderers) compiles at the default
// 128, so the bump is gated on the feature instead of paid unconditionally.
